# Methods are a way of getting shit done, similar to operators except we
# Write the function.
print ("sebastian thrun")
# An object is a piece of information assigned a data type (mostly everything yhh)
# A method is a function belonging to an object, check below:

print ("sebastian thrun".title())

name = "seb thrun"

# Take the example above, title() is a method which makes first character uppercase
# Sebastian Thrun will be the new print. This method belonged to the object
# Sebastian Thrun and had subsequently changed it.


print(name.islower())

# When using a method to change object, will refer to object first, followed by:
# '.' to signify altering argument and then add the method to alter the expression
# In this case it's .isLower() which checks to see if string lower case or nah.
