print (float(3/4))  # statement prints as float (decimal)

print (type(4.5))   # Statement prints type of variable (in this case float).
print (int(16/3))   # Prints only int statement (leaves decimal or remainder).

print (3+2.5)   # Operations with both int and float will result in float.

#Two types of errors in coding:
# Exceptions - errors occuring in code runtime.
# Syntax - errors in the written code found before runtime (during compiling).
